The report plots can be reproduced by running Ischaemia_GlyT1.m and Ischaemia.m (GlyT2). The k values derived from Erdem et. al are in .mat form in the 'data' folder, and are calculated by the make_GlyT1_consts.m and make_GlyT2_consts.m functions in the Calculate_constants folder. This was done by implementing the full system of Erdem et.al as a number of adjacency matrices, and eliminating nodes using by assuming they were in equilibrium using get_constants_ncoeffs.m . Adjacency matrices were indexed as per the imagages in the Calculate_constants folder.  All of the actual kinetic modelling is wrapped in the GlyT1_func.m and GlyT2_func.m functions, which are accessed by the Ischaemia.m scripts.
